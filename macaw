    <h4> Quick note</h4>
    <p>Macaws are prone to feather picking due to boredom, to prevent this provide your feathered friend with a variety of toys to keep them mentally stimulated. It's normal for them to sneeze to clear out dust/dander from their nares but they are susceptible to a few diseases so make sure to have an avian vet on hand and don't miss those regular checkups.</p>
