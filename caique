    <h4> Quick note</h4>
    <p>Cauique's are often getting into trouble and due to their curious nature, they may find themselves in dangerous situations. To avoid this situation try to keep a  close eye on your feathered friend and keep their cage in a safe environment away from the kitchen or other possibly dangerous rooms.</p>
