    <h4> Quick note</h4>
    <p>Indian ringnecks are relatively healthy birds compared to other birds, however, they may be susceptible to polyomavirus, pssitacosis, apergillosis, and bacterial infections so make sure you have an avian vet ready just in case. These birds are strong fliers which means they may need their wings to be clipped a little more than other parrots.</p>
